# Skibidity Minecraft Mod
## By AGMtagious

### This mod container the entire May It Never Falter Album by glaive.
### Currently, this mod is only supported in minecraft 1.21.1 (may also work in 1.21.0) and requires the following prequisits:
### - Fabric Loader (version 0.16.5 for Minecraft 1.21.1), ensure this is installed on the correct version: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/
### - Fabric API (version 0.102.0+1.21.1), select the one uploaded on August 7th, 2024 and place jar file in .minecraft/mods folder inside appdata: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/all?page=1&pageSize=20&version=1.21.1

To use the mod, simply download the jar file and place it into the same .minecraft/mods folder and run minecraft in the appropiate fabric launcher installation. If you have multiple mods in there, id recommend getting a "mod loader" mod.

I plan on updating the mod and adding newer features to it so do look out for newer releases, anyways enjoy:)
